This command is used to build the table of BensonRules. The command line is:

{{{Benson File Source}}}

Benson::
    This is the keyword signifying the building of BensonRules.
File::
    The filename, relative to the current directory, of the file with the ASCII input for BensonRules.
Source::
    A keyword specifying the source of the inputted BensonRules. For example, '''Standard''', for the standard Benson rules of the system.

A sample input line could be:

{{{Benson Groups.input Standard}}}

== Input File ==

The input file has the basic form of the StandardThermodynamicBlock.
The BensonRule is defined as a central atom connected to one or more other atoms.
For each Benson structure there is a set of thermodynamic constants.

Each atom in the BensonRule is a BensonAtom. 

The description starts with a center atom followed by a dash (-).
Each atom in the connection is surrounded by parentheses. If there are more than one, then the number is given after a slash (/).
The next connection follows. Dashes between the connecting atoms is optional.

Some examples:

|| Primary Carbon         || {{{c-(h)/3-(c)}}}   ||
|| Secondary Carbon       || {{{c-(h)/2-(c)/2}}} ||
|| Tertiary Carbon        || {{{c-(h)-(c)/3}}}   ||
|| Double Bonded Carbon   || {{{c/d-(h)/2}}}     ||
