Linear atoms are defined in the SQL table MetaAtomInfo with the {{{MetaAtomType}}} being {{{LinearStructure}}}. 
They can be isolated with the command:

{{{select * from `MetaAtomInfo` where MetaAtomType="LinearStructure"}}}

Some defined linear meta atoms are:
 * Chlorine atom
 * Florine atom
 * Bromine atom
 * Hydrogen atom
 * Ethyne group
