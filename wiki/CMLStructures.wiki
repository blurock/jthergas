This is the SQL table storing the structures and substructures used by JTHERGAS. This is to be differentiated with the SQL table DatabaseMolecule which is the molecular database of JTHERGAS.

CMLStructures have the following fields:

{{{ElementName}}}::
    The keyword corresponding to the structure. This keyword is used in other SQL tables to reference the structure
{{{CMLStructure}}}::
    This is the [wiki:CML CML] form of the structure (as ASCII text).
{{{Source}}}::
    This is a keyword specifying the source of the structure. A common ''source'' is '''Standard''' which means that the structure is part of the standard database. The source can be used to differential, for example, new data from a new source or for testing purposes. It is convenient to use because then the data associated with a given source can be referenced (or even erased) in a block.
