The concept of meta atoms is the key to the flexibility of the JTHERGAS system.
Meta atoms define an '''atom label''' which represents a structure. The structure is defined in CMLElement.
The types of meta atoms are:

BensonAtom ::
    This defined the structures associated with the benson rules, such as single, double, triple or aromatic bonding of carbons (and other elements).
    Also multiple atoms can be defined, such as '''{{{co}}}'''.
LinearStructure ::
    This is how linear structures are defined. A complete linear structure is defined as a chain of individual linear structures. The individual linear structures are defined as meta atoms.
NancyLinearForm ::
    Within the nancy linear form, there are meta atoms defined representing structures. For example '''{{{co}}}'''
{{{StructureMetaAtom}}}::
    This is a structure that is substituted for steric structures. This was especially made to simplify the graph isomorphism problem. A classic example is the methyl group. Matching each methyl group multiplies the number of equivalent matches by 6. For example, a tert-butyl system would match (6*6*6*6)*24 without the methyl substitution and only 24 with.
